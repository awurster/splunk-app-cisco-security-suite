<h3>Understanding additional Splunk for Cisco Security content</h3>

The landing page of the app provides an overall view of your Cisco security events in real time. While each add-on provides a real time dashboard where applicable the landing page is looking across all Cisco add-ons, plotting the events in real time as they happen as well as providing an overview of the src and dest IP's involved. 
<br>
<br>
<br>If you would like to create additional map content for use in Splunk dashboards, you can include GoogleMaps module in your advanced XML views.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Botnet Overview</h4>
The Botnet Overview dashboard utilizes Cisco Firewall's Botnet filter, providing a view into the latest Botnet activity in your environment.
<br>
The Botnet map included with this view is mapping the geo info from the destination IP of the Botnet request. This map is driven off of the results of Cisco Botnet Filter â€“ DataCube.  To make changes to the search schedule or that time frame simply edit the search. 
<br>
<br>
<h4>Global Threat Correlation Overview</h4>
The Global Threat Correlation Overview dashboard is comprised of IPS alerts that surpass defined thresholds for a Global Threat Correlation Score.  By default this is set to 0.

To change the schedule, the time frame reported on, or the GTS thresh-hold you can edit the following search under the manager: Cisco IPS Global Threat Correlation - DataCube
